## Best Practices from Top Projects

### Planning (Critical)

> "Do NOT let the AI plan autonomously, or your codebase will become an unmanageable mess."

1. Create design document first (GDD/PRD)
2. Define tech stack explicitly
3. Break into testable implementation steps
4. Maintain "Memory Bank" of context

### Prompting Strategy

1. Be specific about requirements
2. Include visual/interaction details
3. Specify frameworks (Three.js, etc.)
4. Request validation/testing steps
5. Ask for modular file structure

### Demo Tips

1. Show the "wow" in first 30 seconds
2. Demonstrate real-time features
3. Highlight Gemini-specific capabilities
4. Keep technical explanation brief
5. End with practical impact
